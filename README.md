# Debug an Express Server

This project debugs the given files to get the express server up and running. This is a forked repo, and the original set of buggy files are in the repo that was forked.

## Original Exercise README Below
Node + Express + Express Templates ARE BUSTED!

Task:

* Find all the errors in the code and fix them so the app runs
* There are _multiple_ errors (~15 of them). The app won't run intil they're _all_ fixed.
* As you make it through one error, be on the lookout for the next one.
* __ALL__ files are in play.

Getting started

* First, run `npm i` to install all the dependencies
* Then run `npm run dev` to start the app.
* Start fixing!
